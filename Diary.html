Well today we are going to Cornwall which is really exciting bc we are going to stop at a service station and I'm excited and nervous to use the women's bathroom for the first time!
I also did my makeup today and I think it looks really good! I did a lot of blusher to look extra cute! I put dark contour around the top of my head so it looks thinner and I have a smaller forehead. Oh! I almost forgot to say that I got my wings right in the first try! I love how everything comes together perfectly to make me pass <3 <3

OMG!!!! Two days ago I officially passed to a stranger for the first time!! Me and my mum were shopping for a wetsuit bc we're in cornwall rn and we're right beside the sea, anyway, the shop owner saw that we were having trouble finding the right size so she came over to help. She said to me and I bullshiteth not my joy "It won't go around HER neck, its too short." It made me so happy!!!! Like I mean I have passed to strangers before when I went into the women's bathroom but this is the first time that it has been 100% confirmed <3 <3
